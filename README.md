# Waste Permits Service

You may need to apply to the [Environment Agency](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency) for an environmental permit if your business uses, recycles, treats, stores or disposes of waste or mining waste. This permit can be for activities at one site or for mobile plant that can be used at many sites.

The Waste Permits service will be a new, online way to apply for a waste permit. The service will be based on Dynamics 365 and the Solutions for this are contained within this repository.

This service is currently beta and has been developed in accordance with the [Digital by Default service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/digital-by-default), putting user needs first and delivered iteratively.
